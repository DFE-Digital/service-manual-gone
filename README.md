# The DfE service manual is no longer available

The Standards and Assurance team are working on new content to support service teams in how to apply the Service Standard in DfE. 

This includes:

- standards content for design teams
- improved guidance for service assessments
- an improved service assessment process 

In the meantime, you can find information in the following places: 

- [Service Manual on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual)
- [DfE Technical Guidance](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/)
- [DfE Architecture](https://dfe-digital.github.io/architecture/common-components/#common-components)
- [User Research Slack](https://ukgovernmentdfe.slack.com/archives/C53D6R7SP)

Additionally, you can find information about service assessments on the [DfE Intranet](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/ciog/Service%20Assessment%20Plus/Home.aspx)

As we start to research and design a way to help teams understand how to apply the Service Standard, and what good looks like in DfE, we need to test the content. You can get involved with user research and creating standards content for the content and design communities.
